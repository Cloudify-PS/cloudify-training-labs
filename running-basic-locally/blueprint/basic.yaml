  # Node template that functions as the "Compute" container for our miniature application.
  # It is of the generic "cloudify.nodes.Compute" type.

  # The reason we need this node, even though we'd like to demonstrate the "test_application_server" node below,
  # is that the "test_application_server" node uses the Script Plugin. By default, the Script Plugin is configured
  # so Cloudify runs it on spawned VM's (so-called "agent_host" configuration), rather than on the central
  # management machine ("central_deployment_host" configuration). When the blueprint is being validated, Cloudify
  # ensures that all nodes, which use "agent_host" plugins, are contained within a node of type "cloudify.nodes.Compute"
  # or a subtype thereof.

  # A way to work around that would be to define the Script Plugin usage (in "test_application_server") so the
  # script is run on the Cloudify Manager side. However, that would present complications that are unnecessary at
  # this stage of the training program.
